Orange3 Conformal Prediction
============================

Conformal Prediction is an add-on for [Orange3](http://orange.biolab.si) data mining software package.
It provides an extensive toolset for conformal prediction.

Installation
------------

To install the add-on, run

    python setup.py install

To register this add-on with Orange, but keep the code in the development directory (do not copy it to 
Python's site-packages directory), run

    python setup.py develop

Usage
-----

The library in the add-on can be used in Python scripts. The add-on does not provide any GUI widgets.

The example below evaluates an inductive conformal predictor at 0.1 significance level
on the Iris dataset (spliting it into a training and testing set in ratio 2:1).
The nonconformity scores used by the conformal predictor are based on the probabilities returned
by a Naive Bayes classifier.

    import Orange
    import orangecontrib.conformal as cp

    tab = Orange.data.Table('iris')
    nc = cp.nonconformity.InverseProbability(Orange.classification.NaiveBayesLearner())
    ic = cp.classification.InductiveClassifier(nc)
    r = cp.evaluation.run(ic, 0.1, cp.evaluation.RandomSampler(tab, 2, 1))
    print(r.accuracy())
